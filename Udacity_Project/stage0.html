		<h1>Lesson 1 Notes</h1>
		<h2>World Wide Web</h2>
		<p>The world wide web is a collection of html documents. <em>HTML</em> stands for HyperText Markup Language. It includes <em>hyperlinks</em>
		   which are links between pages. It was invented in the 1990's.</p>
		<p>Files that can exist on the web include:
			<ul>
				<li>plain text files</li>
				<li>html</li>
				<li>images</li>
				<li>audio</li>
				<li>video</li>
			</ul> 
		</p>
		<p>Major components of the web include: the person, their computer and browser, the internet, and servers.
			<ul>
				<li><b>HTTP</b>: the main protocol of the web</li>
				<li><b>servers</b>: computers that host the files that make up the web</li>
				<li><b>internet</b>: the world's largest computer network</li>
				<li><b>browser</b>: a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web</li>
			</ul> 
		</p>
		<h2>HTML</h2>
		<p>HTML is made up of:
			<ul>
				<li><b>text content</b>: what you see</li>
				<li><b>markup</b>: what it looks like</li>
				<li><b>references to other documents</b>: such as images and videos</li>
				<li><b>links to other pages</b></li>
			</ul> </p>
		<h3>Tags</h3>
		<p>To make the text look different use tags. <em>Tags</em> allow you to change the look of the plain text such as italicizing, bolding, or underlining
		text. This is done by enclosing the text that we want to alter with an opening and closing tag such as: <.tag name> content <./tag name>. A period 
		was entered so that html didn't recognize the example as an actual tag and you can see the example; for tags, leave out the period and enter a valid 
		tag name. If the opening or closing tag isn't entered, the text will not be altered.</p>
		<h4>HTML Attributes</h4>
		<p>Tags can have attributes that have a certain name and a value that gives additional information to that particular tag. A tag can have multiple
			attributes. An including an attribute to a tag is shown as: <.tagname attr="value"> content <./tagname>. </p>
		<b>Links</b>
		<p>Links are created using attributes. For example, This website is <a href = "https://www.udacity.com">my favorite</a> is written: This website is 
		<.a href = "https://www.udacity.com"> my favorite<./a>. The content within the a tags creates a link to the href listed.</p>
		<b>Images</b>
		<p>Images are created using the <.img> tag and including the src and alt attributes. An example of this is <.img src="url" alt="text"> where url is 
		where the source image is located and alt is a text alternative to the image just in case the image doesn't load on the site. The image tag does not 
		have any content and therefore no closing tag. This is the result of properly inserting an image:</p>
		<img src="http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png" alt="hipmunk!">
		</p>
		<b>Whitespace</b>
		<p>HTML doesn't recognize whitespace, or empty space. It enters text in a single line, allowing a space between words, unless specified by the break 
		tag,<.br>, at the end of the line we want to break. The break tag is a void tag and doesn't require a closing tag. Another tag we can use to break a 
		line is using the paragraph tag, <.p>content<./p>, which requires a closing tag.</p>
		This is the result<br>of using the break tag. It creates separate lines. 
		<p>And this is the result of using the paragraph tag which creates a line break before the paragraph but doesn't specify when to break the text causing
		it to continue to the end of the margin or the end of the paragraph.</p>
		<b>Inline vs. Block</b>
			<ul>
				<li>br tag is inline; it ends a line. Inline elements are <.b>, <.em>, and <.img>.</li>
				<li>p tag creates a block; creates an invisible box</li>
			</ul>
		<b>Span vs. Div</b>
		<p><em>Span</em> is inline and <em>div</em> is block. Both contain a class attribute to aid in css.</p>
		<span>This is the result of using span</span> One line.
		<div>This is the result of using div</span> Similar to using the paragraph tag.
		<h3>HTML documents</h3>
		The layout for an html document is (again, omit the . when actually creating document):<br>
		<.!DOCTYPE HTML> - HTML5 doctype <br>
		<.html> - surrounds entire html document<br>
			<.head> - includes meta data, title, javascript, and css<br>
				<.title>Title<./title> - appears at tab of browser window<br>
			<./head><br>
		<.body><br>
			<b>Content</b> - what appears in body of document; will mostly be covered by this course<br>
		<./body><br>
		<./html><br>
	</div>
</body>
</html>
